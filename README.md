# Plainconf

Attempts to help build sensible configuration for python projects.

## DISCLAIMER

Unless you need some specific functionality in here, 
I recommend using [Dynaconf](https://www.dynaconf.com/) as it is more mature.


## Install 

```shell
pip install plainconf
```


## What does this do?

It will create a flat conf (no nesting or anything, just one level) 
taking entries from the same environment from
a settings file and either

 * a secrets file

 * hashicorp vault if vault_url, a mount_point and either token, 
   userpass or approle credentials are provided (optionally vault_path)
 
 * a secrets file with fernet encrypted values if the key is provided 
   (s. [encrypting toml file with fernet](#markdown-header-encrypting-toml-file-with-fernet)


settings.toml
``` toml
[development]
db_url = "localhost:4321"
```


.secrets.toml
``` toml
[development]
password = "secret"
``` 


``` python
    conf = Plainconf(
        environment="development",
        settings_file="settings.toml",
        secrets_file=".secrets.toml",
    )

    assert conf.db_url == "localhost:4321"
    assert conf.password == "secret"

``` 


## Encrypting toml file with fernet

In order to encrypt the values in the toml file you will need a fernet key

``` python
    from cyptography.fernet import Fernet

    key = Fernet.generate_key()
```

encrypt_toml(key: bytes, file: str) expects the key as bytes and the path to the secrets file to
be encrypted:

``` python
    from plainconf import encrypt_toml

    encrypt_toml(b'key', '.secrets.toml')
```
Which will output a file ending on \_enc.toml with the values encrypted

``` toml
[development]
password = "gAAAAABlDfsMIkZzIqKFQW8NBHVIqITKLCgQkzr6VKOYglHroZ--jFtkEsFr3feqSL1WCWy7gdlhvjHkBmx_JjQxKYKiqNge0A=="
```

In order to read the encrypted secrets, the key has to be given as 
keyword argument or environment variable (without the b at the beginning)


## Limitations

* Only supports userpass and token authentication on Hashicorp Vault

* Only works with kv secret engine

* Only supports toml

(for now)


## Examples

With files

``` toml
    .mysecrets.toml:

    [development]
    password = 'secret'
```

``` python
    conf = Plainconf(
        secrets_file='.mysecrets.toml', 
        settings_file='mysettings.toml',
        environment='development'
    )
    
    ...

    conf.password ("secret")
```
 

With vault

    on the vault:
    
    somewhere/development:
    password = 'supersecret'


``` python
    conf = Plainconf(
        vault_url="http://localhost:8200",
        vault_token="hvs.abc123def456",
        vault_mount_point="somewhere",
        environment="development"
    )

    conf.password ("supersecret")
```


Enviroment from env

    .env file:

    PLAINCONF_ENVIRONMENT="development"
    PLAINCONF_VAULT_TOKEN="hvs.something123"
    PLAINCONF_VAULT_URL="http://development.vault:8200"

``` python
    conf = Plainconf()
    conf.password ("supersecret")
```
 
### Settings REQUIRED!

    Plainconf(settings_file='path_to_file')
    or environment variable PLAINCONF_SETTINGS_FILE="...""

Settings are read from the respective environment (default: default)

### Secrets 

    Plainconf(secrets_file='path_to_file')
    or environment variable PLAINCONF_SECRETS_FILE="...""

Secrets are read from the environment (default: default)

### Environments

    Plainconf(environment='name')
    or environment variable PLAINCONF_ENVIRONMENT="...""
    or default: default

### Vault

Hashicorp Vault can be accessed via token, approle or userpass.

Required configuration:

* Plainconf(vault_url='http...') 
  or environment variable PLAINCONF_VAULT_URL

* Plainconf(vault_mount_point='name')
  or environment variable PLAINCONF_VAULT_MOUNT_POINT

and either a token 

* Plainconf(vault_token="hvs...") 
  or PLAINCONF_VAULT_TOKEN

or user and pass

* Plainconf(vault_user='user', vault_pass='password') 
  or PLAINCONF_VAULT_USER and PLAINCONF_VAULT_PASS

or approle id and secret

* Plainconf(vault_approle_id='role_id', vault_approle_secret_id='secret_id')
  or PLAINCONF_APPROLE_ID and PLAINCONF_APPROLE_SECRET_ID

Optional:

* Plainconf(vault_path='secret/special...')
  or PLAINCONF_VAULT_PATH
  or default: environment (see above)

Plainconf tries to connect to the vault kv secrets engine v2 by default 
and v1 thereafter.


## Fernet Key

* Plainconf(fernet_key='key')
  or PLAINCONF_FERNET_KEY'
